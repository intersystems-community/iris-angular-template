              <h1>Overview</h1>
              <p>The scaffold is a basic angular application that interfaces with IRIS.
                It includes a script for automated setup so that developers have a ready environment to code in.</p>
              <p>The AppScaffold uses the <a href="https://github.com/intersystems/ipm">InterSystems Package Manager</a> to easily install applications onto new machines.</p>
              <p>The rest of the tabs on this page contain some useful guide on navigating features of the scaffold app</p>
              <h2>Basic Use</h2>
              <p>The Angular application can be hosted locally using <code>ng serve</code>, as well as on your IRIS instance. In order to re-run the angular build that is hosted on your IRIS instance, run the command <code>zpm "app-name activate"</code> in your IRIS terminal.</p>
              <p>The "proxy.conf.js" file is used to point to the IRIS instance you are using. If working with a remote iris instance, you can change the proxy to point to that instance.</p>
              <p>For information on how to set up VSCode for IRIS, refrer to the documentation: <a href="https://docs.intersystems.com/components/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=GVSCO">Documentation</a></p>
              <h2>Source Control</h2>
              <p>The Scaffold uses <a href="https://github.com/intersystems/git-source-control/tree/main">git-source-control</a> to manage server-side source control using Git. For more information visit the github repository.</p>
            </mat-tab>
            <mat-tab label="REST Services">
              <h1>REST Services</h1>
              <p>The AppScaffold uses the isc.rest package from zpm for REST services, which is installed during setup.</p>
              <h2>Creating a REST Service</h2>
              <p>First, we want to have a class extend %pkg.isc.rest.model, either the adaptor or the resource. This class must also have a parameter called RESOURCENAME</p>
              <code>Class Example.Class Extends (%Persistent, %pkg.isc.rest.model.adaptor)
                <br>Parameter RESOURCENAME = "example";  
              </code>
              <p>After writing a method or query that we want to call from angular, we must define an ActionMap, to expose the REST endpoint. The actionmap can have many action endpoints.</p>
              <p>If we wanted to call a <code>DoSomething</code> class in our code from an endpoint, it will be as follows:</p>
              <code>
                XData ActionMap [XMLNamespace = â€œhttp://www.instersystems.com/_pkg/isc/rest/action" ] {{'{'}}
                    <br>&ensp;&lt;actions&gt;
                    <br>&emsp;&lt;action name="do-something" method="GET" call="DoSomething" target="class"&gt;
                    <br>&emsp;&lt;argument name="objectName" target="objectName" source="body" required="true" /&gt;
                    <br>&emsp;&lt;/action&gt;
                    <br>&ensp;&lt;/actions&gt;
                    <br>{{"}"}}
              </code>
              <p>Finally, we want to create a ClassMethod called "CheckPermission", which decides whether a REST operation is allowed.</p>
                <code>
                    ClassMethod CheckPermission(pID As %String, pOperation As %String, pUserContext As %RegisteredObject, ByRef URLParams) As %Boolean {{"{"}}
                    <br>&ensp;Quit $IsObject(pUserContext) && ((pOperation = $$$OperationAction("do-something"))
                    <br>{{"}"}}
                </code>
                <p> We can add each future action that we want to allow to the CheckPermission method. This gives us a basic setup for REST calls using IRIS.</p>
              <h2>OpenAPI generator</h2>
                <p>OpenAPI generator is a tool that generates REST API documentation from a REST API specification. The scaffold uses the openapi-generator-cli to generate the documentation, and turn it into angular services.</p>
                <p>OpenAPI generation requires the installation of Java version 11 on your system.</p>
                <p>To use the generator with the Scaffold, simply run the command <code>zpm "app-name generate"</code> in your iris terminal locally. This will generate services and function inside of a ./generated folder in your angular application root.</p>
            </mat-tab>
            <mat-tab label="Authentication">
            <h1>Authentication</h1>
            <p>The scaffold comes with IRIS authentication, meaning that your credentials for the IRIS instance would be used to log into the angular application. If this is the desired funnctionality,
                nothing needs to be changed. If you however want to use a different authentication method, you can enable delegated authentication for the web application.</p>
            <h2>Delegated Authentication</h2>
            <p>To activate delegated authentication, change the authentication of the app-name/api web application in the management portal to delegated. After that, you should create a <a href="https://docs.intersystems.com/iris20232/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=TSQS_DelAuthExPartOne">ZAUTHENTICATE.MAC</a> routine in a 'rtn' subfolder of the project, inside of which you will put your custom authentication code. Finally, you should update the module.xml file by adding the ZAUTHENTICATE routine as a resource, and then run <code>zpm "app-name activate</code>" in your IRIS terminal.</p>
